# Black Hole Compression Model

This module simulates:

- Compression increase approaching a singular region
- Particle acceleration toward compression maxima
- Visualization of stability regions

Interactive example:

ðŸ‘‰ See Notebook: `intro_to_cf.ipynb`

> Future releases will include an API for researchers to run custom simulations.
