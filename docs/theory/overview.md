# Theory Overview

The Compressive Framework proposes that:

> Gravity is fundamentally a **compressive result** of spatial curvature acting upon matter or quantum fields.

Instead of being purely attractive, CF models gravity as:

- A **pressure differential** created by curvature gradients
- Particles move toward maximal compression
- Structure emerges where compression is minimized

## Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Spatial Compression | Curved geometry creates directional pressure |
| Particle Behavior | Particles follow compression gradients |
| Stability | Stable orbits = compression equilibrium |
| Collapse | Runaway compression → black holes |
