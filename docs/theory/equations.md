# Equations (Early-Phase)

CF uses compression-field potentials instead of force-based formulations.

We define:
- \( C(x) \) — Compression field at position \(x\)
- \( \nabla C(x) \) — Compression gradient (drives motion)
- \( m \) — Particle mass

### Motion Law Prototype

\[
\mathbf{F}_{c} = -m \, \nabla C(x)
\]

### Stability Condition

\[
\nabla C(x) = 0 \Rightarrow \text{compression equilibrium}
\]

More detailed tensors and curvature mappings are under development.
Contributors may propose alternative formulations.
