## 🔍 What is CF?

Compressive Framework models particles as **coherent energy geometries**  
instead of destructive collisions.

It enables study of:

✔ Harmonic wobble suppression  
✔ Anchor clustering auto-tuning  
✔ Multi-arm fractal stability  
✔ Phase coherence under compression

## 🧪 Research Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| CF-D Fractal Arm Model | Most stable configuration for maintaining phase coherence |
| Wobble Suppression | Limits torque oscillation in >6D compression |
| Anchor Clustering | Real-time stability correction algorithm |
| Harmonic Geometry Explorer | Visual model of resonance transitions |

> These are **simulated** — not physical device claims ✅ safe and compliant.
