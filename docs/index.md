# Framework Overview

The Compressive Framework (CF) models multidimensional harmonic coherence and stability under varying compressive gradients. It offers a unified approach to field interactions without assuming destructive particle collisions.

This documentation covers the architecture, mathematics, and contribution guidelines for the project.
