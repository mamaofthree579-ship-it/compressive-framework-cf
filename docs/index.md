# Compressive Framework (CF)

A research framework for studying **compressive behavior in particle-based systems** â€” from astrophysics to condensed matter.

> Open science for compressive modeling, simulation, and analysis.

## ðŸ”¬ What is Compressive Dynamics?

Compressive dynamics describes **how matter behaves under pressure**:

- Particles deform
- Waveforms change
- Forces redistribute
- Energy compacts

Understanding these effects helps improve modeling in:

âœ… Nuclear physics  
âœ… Materials engineering  
âœ… High-energy simulations  
âœ… Dense astrophysical objects

## ðŸ“ˆ Interactive Simulation (Coming Soon)

This page will include:

- A waveform visualizer
- Sliders for compression parameters
- Real-time numerical plots

Example prototype:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 500)
compression = 2.5
wave = np.sin(x * compression)

plt.plot(x, wave)
plt.title("Compressive Waveform Demo")
plt.xlabel("Position")
plt.ylabel("Amplitude")
plt.grid(True)
