# Compressive Framework (CF)

The **Compressive Framework (CF)** is a research model designed to explore:

- Gravitational compression as a *primary* physical force
- Particle dynamics under extreme curvature
- The emergence of structure from compression-driven behavior

This is an **open scientific effort**, with ongoing development of:

âœ… Mathematical derivations  
âœ… Computational models  
âœ… Simulation tools  
âœ… Visual representations of compressive behavior  

---

## Project Goals

- Provide a unified modeling framework for compressive gravitational fields
- Explore particle interaction under compression-based behavior
- Develop notebooks, simulations, and an open API for researchers
