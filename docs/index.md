# Compressive Framework

Welcome to the **Compressive Framework (CF)** ‚Äî an open computational model designed to explore **harmonic coherence**, **field compression**, and **particle behavior** through mathematical and visual simulation.

---

## üî≠ Overview

The Compressive Framework provides a neutral, simulation-driven environment to study how geometry, pressure gradients, and harmonic patterns interact in multidimensional models.  

It does **not rely on hardware experimentation** or unverified energy claims ‚Äî instead, it focuses on **mathematical structure**, **wave harmonics**, and **computational reproducibility**.

## üß† Core Concepts

### 1. Harmonic Field Simulation
CF models the behavior of coherent wave packets and energy densities under controlled, virtual compression parameters.

### 2. Stability and Coherence
Through resonance balancing, the framework identifies when compression and harmonic amplification create stable, self-organizing structures.

### 3. Visualization and Pattern Emergence
Each simulation produces field geometries, density maps, and dynamic standing-wave patterns ‚Äî visual metaphors for how particles might organize within harmonic systems.
